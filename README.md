## FLowers - ML AI

this is a direct  copy of the truly awesome intro article at

written by  Jason Brownlee, PhD.


## Project Setup

All i have actually done is change the layout of the project to assist with ground zero learning for developers.

The project is seperated into 3 main parts and folders

1. dataset
2. format 
3. learning

### dataset

Includes the pandasService we use pandas to do the pre work pandas lets us

1. read in a csv file from a url
2. create a pandas internal model which makes data manipulation and filtering quick
3. export the pandas data model into other modules like AI modules

### format

Simple formatter which leads to easy to read commandline output

### learning

Includes the psykitLearnService provided by psyKitLearn module this module let us 

1. take in a data model generated by pandas
2. create a basic ML model to run simulations on where we use 80% of the data to train the models and 20% to validate
3. run multiple algorythms against a data set
4. compare algorythms against a data set
5. predict beyond the 80% data set into the 20% data set with some degree of confidence
